{"name":"Recdb-postgresql","tagline":"RecDB is a recommendation engine built entirely inside PostgreSQL 9.2","body":"### Welcome to RecDB.\r\nAn Open Source Recommendation Engine Built Entirely Inside PostgreSQL 9.2. RecDB allows application developers to build recommendation applications in a heartbeat through a wide variety of built-in recommendation algorithms like user-user collaborative filtering, item-item collaborative filtering, singular value decomposition. Applications powered by RecDB can produce online and flexible personalized recommendations to end-users. You can check out the code, as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ssh clone https://github.com/Sarwat/recdb-postgresql.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nOnce you've synced with GitHub, the folder should contain the source code for PostgreSQL, as well as several Perl scripts and several different .jar files.\r\n\r\n1. Run the installation script install.pl.\r\n\r\n```\r\nperl install.pl [abs_path]\r\n```\r\n\r\n[abs_path] is the absolute path to the directory where you want PostgreSQL installed. The directory should exist before running this script.\r\n\r\n2. Run the database server script pgstart.pl.\r\n\r\n```\r\nperl pgstart.pl\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe install.pl script stores the install path, so there shouldn't be any need to specify it.\r\n\r\n3. In a second terminal, run the database interaction script dbstart.pl.\r\n\r\n```\r\nperl dbstart.pl [db_name] [server_host]\r\n```\r\n\r\n[db_name] is the name of the database that you intend to use.\r\n[server_host] is the address of the host server running the PostgreSQL backend. If this option is not specified, the script assumes it to be \"localhost\".\r\n\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you need to rebuild PostgreSQL, there are two options.\r\n\r\nIf you have not modified the grammar, you can do a quick rebuild with remake.pl.\r\n\r\n```\r\nperl remake.pl\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you have modified the grammar, you will need to do a longer rebuild with remakefull.pl.\r\n\r\n```\r\nperl remakefull.pl [abs_path]\r\n```\r\n\r\n[abs_path] is the absolute path to the directory where you want PostgreSQL installed. The directory should exist before running this script.\r\n\r\nIf you ever want to eliminate the current database , use the clean.pl script.\r\n\r\n```\r\nperl clean.pl [db_name] [server_host]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Loading Data\r\nWe provide the MovieLens data to build a \"Hello-World\" movie recommendation application using RecDB. You can load the data using the sql script called \"initmovielens1mdatabase.sql\" stored in \"./PostgreSQL\" directory. We provide the dataset at \"./PostgreSQL/moviedata / MovieLens1M/\" directory.\r\n\r\n### Recommendation Query\r\n\r\n### Materializing Recommenders\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with RecDB ? contact sarwat@cs.umn.edu and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
